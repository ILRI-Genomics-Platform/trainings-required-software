# Required software during bioinformatics trainings
In Windows operating system computers, we need to set up software that we can use to access
the remote server (HPC) and easily tranfer data from the remote server to our local computers. Additionally, we can

Below is a list of the software that you need installed:

## Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL)

## MobaXterm

## WinSCP
